**Scientists of the [[International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment]] announce that they have found a way to squeeze the [[muons]] of a [[muon beam]] into a smaller volume. The muons are cooled into a denser cloud by being directed through specially designed energy-absorbing materials while the beam is tightly focused by powerful superconducting magnetic lenses and can then be accelerated by a normal particle accelerator in a precise direction. This technique may allow the construction of a [[muon collider]]. Cooling the muons beams is crucial to achieve a high collision rate.<ref>{{cite news |title=World's most powerful particle accelerator one big step closer |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-02-world-powerful-particle-big-closer.html |website=phys.org |accessdate=8 March 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Garisto |first1=Daniel |title=MICE Cold: Collaboration Demonstrates Muon Ionization Cooling |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mice-cold-collaboration-demonstrates-muon-ionization-cooling/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=8 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bogomilov |first1=M. |last2=Tsenov |first2=R. |last3=Vankova-Kirilova |first3=G. |last4=Song |first4=Y.

**A global scientific collaboration of ca. 100 institutions publishes their analysis of three decades of tree growth and death in 565 undisturbed tropical forests across Africa and the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. The researchers found that the overall uptake of carbon into Earth's intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s, dropped by one-third on average by the 2010s and may have started a downward trend. While extra carbon dioxide boosts tree growth, the effect is countered by negative impacts of higher temperatures and droughts which slow growth and can kill trees. Their models project a long-term decline in the African [[carbon sink]] and the Amazonas likely becoming a carbon source, rather than sink, in the mid-2030s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tropical forests' carbon sink is already rapidly weakening |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-tropical-forests-carbon-rapidly-weakening.html |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=correspondent |first1=Fiona Harvey Environment |title=Tropical forests losing their ability to absorb carbon, study finds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/tropical-forests-losing-their-ability-to-absorb-carbon-study-finds |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hubau |first1=Wannes |last2=Lewis |first2=Simon L. |last3=Phillips |first3=Oliver L. |last4=Affum-Baffoe |first4=Kofi |last5=Beeckman |first5=Hans |last6=Cuní-Sanchez |first6=Aida |last7=Daniels |first7=Armandu K. |last8=Ewango |first8=Corneille E.

**Neuroscientists report that [[rat]]s show [[harm aversion]] with the brain region [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), which is also associated with harm aversion in humans, being activated. Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment – including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered. Furthermore, prior experience with footshocks was shown to increase the rats' harm aversion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rats avoid hurting other rats |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-rats.html |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rats avoid harming other rats.
